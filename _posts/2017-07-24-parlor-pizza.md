Happy Birthday to Tyler for this edition of pizza time! While there were a few
extra people this time around it allowed us to sample more pizzas. We tried
roughly half of the pizzas that Parlor had to offer, and personally I think
the great balls of fire was the best one and also have to give a shout out to
their nachos, the best in the city of Chicago (new blog idea if we were able to
  competently run this one...)

  Highlights of the night were drinking and Ian being unable to stand still for a
  photo. The picture turned out great, for some reason I was super angry in it though.

### Scores
* Ambience - 8.5
* Presentation - 7.2
* Smell - 6.4
* Crust - 6.1
* Taste - 8.1
* Price - 6.7
* X factor - 8.8
* Overall - 7.4

### Thoughts
The pizzas here were all very different, we broke away from our first idea of eating
a cheese pizza and using that to judge the sauce and cheese. Since this was a birthday
we went a little more rogue and had a bit more to drink. Not a lot of pizza discussion
as we were eating.

Outside of that I think we are improving at our pizza judging abilities but still having
trouble getting everyone to fill out their score cards. Hopefully we'll get the instagram
going soon and have some more fun pictures out there.
