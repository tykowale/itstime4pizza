Our inaugural pizza time was a ton of fun. Tyler was feeling a little under the
weather but still managed to have fun. The restaurant was very open to our
photography and even let Matt go back into the kitchen and take a few action
shots. The service was top notch and pizzas came out surprisingly quickly.
It was an odd choice to go to a place that served Brooklyn and Detroit
style pizza as our first outing but it was a great time.

### Thoughts
The sauce was super simple but very tasty. It was hard to judge crusts because we
ordered a thin crust and a thicker Detroit style pizza. We were all fans of the
Detroit style but had differing opinions on the Brooklyn style pies. Looking forward
to the next restaurant!
