There was a lot of discussion over how we would grade the pizzas, and at the
end of the day we settled on the follow:

### Ambience
Is the restaurant somewhere you would enjoy eating pizza? Can we have a
conversation or is the music too loud?

### Presentation
When the pizza is set on the table is your first thought "I want to eat that" or
is it "What is on top of that?" We don't expect anything fancy but you see
your food before you eat it

### Smell
Nothing is better than a good smelling pizza

### Crust
The one thing all pizzas have in common. It will be different but it is the base
for flavor.

### Taste
The heart of the whole scale

### Price
It can be the greatest slice you ever had before but if it is a million dollars,
is it worth it?

### X factor
What sets this pizza place apart from every where else? Best service?
Wood fire oven? This is the wild card section and will be treated as such

Everything will be rated between 0-10 and it's open to change anytime we
feel that it can't accurately represent the pizza. This is a first crack but
we think it's a solid foundation. Looking forward to putting some numbers on some pizzas
